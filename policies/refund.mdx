# **Eligibility for Refunds**

Customers who are dissatisfied with our products or services may be eligible for a refund if a request is submitted within 14 calendar days from the date of purchase. Eligibility for a refund depends on the use of a qualifying payment method and whether the service in question meets the criteria outlined in our refund policies.

# **Requesting a Refund**

To initiate a refund, a support ticket must be submitted to our sales department within the 14-day period. A cancellation request alone does not constitute a refund request and will not be processed as such. Once approved, refunds will be issued within 7 business days; however, bank processing times may result in additional delays before the funds are reflected in your account.

# **Fees and Deductions**

When processing refunds, certain fees and deductions may apply. Any payment processing fees incurred during the original transaction will be deducted from the refund amount. Additionally, please note that the License Cost is excluded from any refund. Refund requests may also be denied if suspicious or fraudulent activity is detected.

# **Refund** **Limitations**

Refunds are subject to limitations. Each account is eligible for refunds on a maximum of five servers. Beyond this limit, a 60% processing fee will be applied to any additional refund requests.

# **Terms of Service Violations**

Refunds will not be granted if we determine that the customer has violated our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policies. Virtual servers suspected of being used for cryptocurrency-related activities are also ineligible for refunds.

# **Policy Updates**

This refund policy may be updated periodically. It is the customer's responsibility to review any changes. In the event of significant updates, CloudBud may provide notification via email.
