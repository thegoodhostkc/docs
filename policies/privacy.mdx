# **Data Collection**

We collect information that you provide directly when you create an account, subscribe to our services, participate in interactive features, fill out forms, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we collect may include your name, email address, postal address, and other contact or identifying details you choose to provide.

In addition to user-provided data, we collect anonymous information from all website visitors to monitor traffic patterns and address technical issues. This may include web requests and response data, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser types and language settings, as well as timestamps of access.

We also utilize tracking technologies such as cookies to gather information. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help enable certain website functionalities and improve user experience.

# **Use of Data**

Your personal information is used solely for service provision and communication regarding our website or services. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access.

We do not share your personally identifiable information without your consent, except when necessary to fulfill your request, enforce legal agreements, comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud or security threats, respond to law enforcement inquiries, or dispute chargebacks.

# **Data Sharing**

To facilitate payment transactions, we work with third-party payment gateways such as PayPal and HitPay. These services may receive certain personal information, such as your full name and email address, to complete and validate transactions. It is your responsibility to review and understand their respective privacy policies before utilizing their services. CloudBud does not control or assume responsibility for the data practices of third-party service providers.

# **Security**

We take reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, we cannot be held liable for security breaches that occur beyond our control.

# **Chargebacks**

If a chargeback is initiated, we reserve the right to provide relevant details to our payment processor to contest the dispute. This may include proof of service or product delivery, IP addresses and access logs, account details, ticket transcripts, service information, and server credentials.

# **Legal Compliance**

In the event of a legal complaint, court order, or request from law enforcement authorities, we may disclose any relevant data that we have collected or logged. Compliance is generally determined based on the jurisdiction where your service is located.

# **Data Deletion**

To request the removal of your personal data, you must open a support ticket. We will delete as much of your information as possible within 30 business days. However, in some cases, we may retain certain data to prevent fraudulent activities, subject to your geographical location and applicable regulations. For further details, please contact us.

# **Policy Updates**

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. It is your responsibility to review any changes. In cases of significant updates, we may provide notification via email.
