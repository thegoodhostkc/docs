# **99.99% Uptime**

TheGoodHost is committed to delivering a 99.99% uptime guarantee, ensuring network and host node availability under this Service Level Agreement (SLA). This SLA serves as a supplement to the Terms of Service you agreed to upon becoming a TheGoodHost customer and is an integral part of your service agreement.

This uptime guarantee applies on a per-service-item basis, meaning it does not cover your entire invoice. For example, if you have fifty servers and one experiences downtime, any credit issued under this guarantee will be proportional to that specific server’s downtime rather than your entire account.

# **Packet Loss and Latency**

TheGoodHost does not actively monitor packet loss or transmission latency for individual customers but continuously assesses aggregate performance across its Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). If TheGoodHost detects, either through internal monitoring or a customer report, that packet loss exceeds 1% between your instance and the first hop from TheGoodHost’s border routers, you must submit a support ticket to initiate a resolution process. Once notified, TheGoodHost will take the necessary steps to identify and address the source of excessive packet loss or latency.

# **Limitations**

This uptime guarantee strictly covers network and instance availability under normal operating conditions and does not extend to server-side software uptime. Outages caused by software failures, operating system issues, misconfigurations, denial-of-service attacks, instance suspensions, or halts for any reason are excluded. Additionally, the guarantee does not apply to scheduled maintenance with at least 24 hours' notice or urgent security patches, provided the outage does not exceed 10 minutes.

Credits cannot be combined across multiple service interruptions. If a hardware failure disrupts network activity, it will be classified as a single outage, meaning you will not receive multiple credits for different affected aspects of the service.

# **Outage Credits**

To request an outage credit, you must initiate a support ticket and explicitly request a credit for the downtime. Simply reporting an outage does not qualify for compensation. TheGoodHost will assess the request and determine, at its sole discretion, whether an eligible outage has occurred. If approved, the credit will be issued based on the defined SLA criteria.

| **Outage Time Frame** | **Credit Amount**   |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| Less than 9 minutes   | 12 Hours            |
| 10 – 59 minutes       | 24 Hours            |
| 60 – 119 minutes      | 48 Hours            |
| 120 – 239 minutes     | 120 Hours           |
| 240 – 419 minutes     | 240 Hours           |
| 420\+ minutes         | 672 Hours (1 Month) |

# **How to Obtain Your Credit**

To receive any credit offered under this SLA, you must initiate a support ticket related to the event and expressly request that we issue a credit. Do not assume we are aware of your outage, as it may be entirely unrelated to TheGoodHost's services. Unless you contact us via a support ticket, we may not be aware that any issue exists. Outages caused by hardware failures, third-party services, or events beyond TheGoodHost’s control do not qualify for any guarantee or credit under this SLA.

You can submit a support ticket by emailing [support@thegoodhost.io](mailto:support@thegoodhost.io) or using our client portal. Regardless of the method, you must obtain a TheGoodHost ticket number as proof that your request was initiated. The support ticket must explicitly request a credit related to the outage. The timestamp on the support ticket will be used to determine the beginning of an outage if TheGoodHost confirms that an eligible outage has occurred. If TheGoodHost was aware of the issue before you, we may notify you, but you must still submit a support ticket to acknowledge the outage and formally request a credit. Without a support ticket number, no credits will be issued under this SLA.

By requesting a credit, you acknowledge that all other terms, limitations, exclusions, disclaimers, and requirements outlined in TheGoodHost's Terms of Service apply to this SLA.
